# Machine Learning Experiments

Implementations and experiments concerning core machine learning ideas.

* `perceptron.py`: python class of a linear perceptron
* `binaryPerceptron.py`: instatiation of a perceptron to classify two classes
* `SVM.py`: Support Vector Machine with sequential quadratic programming
* `kernelperceptron.py`: a demonstration of how a perceptron can be used as a kernel function, combined with another perceptron
* `multiperceptron`: investigation into multiple perceptrons classifying from an initial state space of two initial continuous dimensions to multiple discrete classes
* `NeuralNetwork.ml`: a poly/ML implementation of a neural network with a quadratic cost function
